1. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a simple tool that fetches a RuneScape player's high scores 
stats and allows you to save them, compare users, etc.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2. What's New?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Following the Hunter skill update, the layout of the personal high scores
page was changed, at least on the HTML code part. The parser has been updated to
work with the new changes.

This version has a slightly changed GUI layout to match that of the
new Windows MFC port. This version was released alongside the Windows
version to reduce confusion.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3. Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For detailed instructions, see the INSTALL file provided in this
distribution.

There are a few dependencies that are required:
-gtkmm-2.4
-libcurl

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4. Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At this point, the app is very simple to use. Basically, you just type
in the desired player's name in the text box. Once you feel confident,
click the Go button, and the stats will be downloaded.

You can check the progress by checking the status bar on the bottom. Any
errors will also be displayed.

Additionally, you can compare the skills of two users by going to
the Tools menu and selecting Compare. Select the two players to
compare and click OK. The skills will be high-lighted in one of four colors:
-Green means the first player has the higher skill
-Red means the second player has the higher skill
-Yellow means both players have an equal level in the skill (very, very unlikely, but possible)
-Gray means one or both players' skills are not ranked
