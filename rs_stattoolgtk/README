1. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a simple tool that fetches a RuneScape player's high scores 
stats and allows you to save them, compare users, etc.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2. What's New?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The high scores lite service is now used to fetch stats. Also, a system tray icon is available if the tray is visible.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3. Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For detailed instructions, see the INSTALL file provided in this
distribution.

There are a few dependencies that are required:
-gtkmm-2.4
-libcurl

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4. Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The most basic function allows you to fetch a player's stats from the 
RuneScape high scores page. Simply type in the player's name in the name
box, and hit Go. The stats will be downloaded and displayed.

You can check the progress by looking the status bar on the bottom. Any
errors will also be displayed.

Once you have downloaded a player's stats, you have the possibility of saving them
to a file for future use. Right click the tab of the player in question, and select
'Save Stats' to have the information saved to a file with a time stamp. The files can
be loaded by going to File -> Open. The context menu also provides the ability to refresh
a player's stats by redownloading them from the RuneScape high scores page. You can view
some basic information about the player by selecting 'View Info' from that same context menu.
This will bring up a dialog showing the player's formatted name, total level, and total experience
points.

Comparing is now slightly different from the previous versions. The feature has
been made more flexible with the introduction of file comparison. If you want to
compare two players in real time, make sure you first download their stats. Then, in
the selection dialog, select their names via the combo boxes. Additionally, if you
want to compare real time stats with a file, check the box below one of the two
player group boxes. This will allow you to select a file with which the stats will be
compared against. You can also do a file-to-file comparison by checking both check boxes
in the selection dialog. Files include a time stamp, you can have a time reference when
they were saved.

Skills will be highlighted in one of four colors, as documented here:
-Green means the first player has the higher skill
-Red means the second player has the higher skill
-Yellow means both players have an equal level in the skill (very, very unlikely, but possible)
-Gray means one or both players' skills are not ranked
